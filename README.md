website scraper

The idea of writing a website scraper came about when a colleague needed to spam all the [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com "CoderDojo")  champions, listed on the  [Zen](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojo "Zen") page. Which lead to playing with the python [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ "BeautifulSoup") library. When the purpose was fulfilled, I decided to repurpose it as a utility script that scrapes links on a page based on a filter.

The work was done on a x86_64 machine running Ubuntu 14.04 with the additional prerequisite of installing BeautifulSoup (apt-get install python-bs4).
